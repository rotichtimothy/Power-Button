# Power-Button
This project implements a responsive theme toggle button using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can switch between light and dark modes by clicking a power button. The button and icon dynamically change color based on the selected theme, with preferences saved in localStorage for a consistent experience across sessions.
