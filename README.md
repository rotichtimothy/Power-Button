# Theme Toggle Button Project

This project implements a responsive theme toggle button using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The button allows users to switch between light and dark modes, with the button and icon colors adjusting dynamically based on the selected theme. The user's theme preference is saved in `localStorage` to persist across sessions.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The toggle button is centered on the page and adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Theme Switching**: Switch between light and dark modes with a single click.
- **Persistent Theme Preference**: The selected theme is saved in the browser's `localStorage` and applied automatically on page load.
- **Interactive Button**: The button features smooth transitions and an interactive press effect.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and the embedded JavaScript code for theme toggling.
- `styles.css`: (Optional) For additional styles if you decide to separate CSS from the HTML.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
2. Click the power button in the center of the screen to toggle between light and dark themes.
3. The page will remember your preferred theme for future visits.

## Customization

- Modify the colors in the CSS section of `index.html` to match your design preferences.
- Extend the functionality by adding more themes or adjusting the animation effects.
